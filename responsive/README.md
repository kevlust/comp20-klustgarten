# Lab 4: Responsive Design

# I believe that most things have been correctly implemented. The GIF image
# is responsive, and my responsive.css file passes the CSS validator test.

# I did not work with any other student or TA. Ming helped me fix an issue
# with my SSH key.

# I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
