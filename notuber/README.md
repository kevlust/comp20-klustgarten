Assignment 2: Not Uber

I believe that most things have been correctly implemented:
- I have every file needed.
- I use the navigator.geolocation object to get my location.
- I send my location to the datastore successfully.
- I display my location on the map with a unique marker.
- I display the other users correctly, depending on what they are.
  Their info windows display the right information.
- There are no console.log() outputs or error messages.

I received helped from Michael Morisi, Flora Liu,
John Gallagher and Ming Chow during TA office hours.

I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.
