Lab 5: The Epic Fail (Annotations)

I believe that most things have been correctly implemented; the song lyrics
show up at the right time and place, index.html passes the html validator
and style.css passes the CSS validator. JavaScript code has no errors or
warnings.

I did not collaborate with any other student or TA.

I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
